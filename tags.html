                <p>A lot of items are needed for a fish to thrive.  Many different fish need different enviorments to survive.<br>  Just because a fish can fit does not mean that is the best fit for the fish to live in.

            <h4><b>Cycle Tank</b></h4> <!-- talking about the nitrogen cycle tanks have to go through -->
                <p>This is probably the most important from your success with fish living in a fish tank.  <br>This is based on bactieria in the tank that can transform the bad bacteria that can kill your fish into <br> good bacteria that helps them thrive.  Otherwise known as the <dfn>nitrogen cycle.</dfn>
                    <br><ol>
                        <li>Get a bowl small enough to fit through the top  of the tank</li>
                        <li>Began scooping our water until you have taken 25% of the water out of the tank</li>
                        <li>Now began to fill the bowl up with water and condition the water based on the directions on the back of the conditioner</li>
                        <li>After conditioning the water slowly pour the water back into the tank till it is full again</li>
                        <li>And that is it! <i> Now you have clean water and happy fish </i></li>
                By doing these steps you will find that your fish are healthy and happy.  Waiting a week after a tank being set up is another <br> really <b>important</b> thing to do.
