            <p>The most common sex of betta that people get are males.  They are a beautiful choice but they do come with
            their own struggles and challenges.  Males bettas are much more aggressive than the females but they also come
            with much more elaborate fins.  Due to these fins you have to be careful about the filter used.
            A low flow filter is key to keepiing these fins healthy and pretty.
